B.  Attendance System

C.  We plan to work on an app whose primary function is to track attendance. This app also has a secondary infraction documenting function, which is stored alongside attendance
    data on a local database.

D.  This app streamlines the attendance taking process and provides an easy way to store data. The most common method of tracking attendance is using spreadsheets, which can  
     become tedious and sometimes difficult to use. Our Attendance System allows for easy data input and storage through a simple and effective user interface, making taking 
     attendance easy and carefree.
     
E.  We plan to develop the app inside Visual Studios using the C++ language.

F.  The input of our project is the raw attendance/infraction data from the user. 
    The output of our project is the organization and storage of the inputted data inside a local database, which the user can access through an interface.
